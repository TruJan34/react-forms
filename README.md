List and Keys:
component can read props.id, but not props.key

Forms:
form elements naturally keep some internal state

 it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and 
 has access to the data that the user entered into the form. 
 The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.
 
 modify or validate user input in the handler
